# fileset_disconnect
A script that uses the Rubrik API to disassociate a fileset from a NAS share

This Python script uses the API to delete a fileset from a NAS share. A Windows binary is included for those without Python.
If you use the Windows binary, be sure to take the entire directory and keep the files together.  Otherwise, just the python
source will work.
